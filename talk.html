# Haskell at ByteAlly

* FMap - A transpiler to convert Haskell EDSL to mobile platforms generating human readable code. 
* FRF  - Workflow library that is easy to define & visualize business processes.
* TypeQL - A query language for the internet.

-----
# TypeQL

* Query, compose and transform data from any data source.

        usrs = Read DB User {}

        usrAndProfs = InnerJoin { usrs  = Read DB User {} 
                                , profs = Api Profile {}
                                } { input joinOn
                                   :with { usrs.id
                                         , profs.userId
                                         }
                                   :using-hs (==)
                                  }

        usrsAbove20 = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                     :using-hs `>= 20`
                                   }

-----

* translates to

        type Usrs = Read DB User '[]

        type UsrAndProfs =
          InnerJoin '[ "usrs"  := Read DB User '[]
                     , "profs" := Api Profile '[]
                     ] '[ Input "joinOn" `With`
                     [ "usrs" :. "id", "profs" :. "userId" ]
                       `Using` "=="
                     ]

        type Usrs = Read DB User '[ FilterBy '[S "age"]
                                    `Using` ">= 20""
                                  ]

* execute the query by

        runTypeQuery @Usrs

-----

# Reifying query

- Type query is converted into a richer (type level) ast called tree.
- The reification is done with (closed) type families.



        type family F a where
          F Int  = Double
          F Bool = Char
          F a    = String

-----

# Reifying query (2)
  * Validations at type level
  * invalid targetting or filter type mismatch

            usrs = Read DB User { FilterBy time, Avg name }

  * Custom type errors are really useful to emit domain specific errors.

        type family F a where
          F Int  = Double
          F Bool = Char
          F a    = TypeError ('Text "It isn't Int or Bool")

  * The reified "tree" is also used for editor completions.

-----

# Implementing actions and combinators

  * Typeclasses for exposing an interface

        class Action act where
          .. 

        class Combinator cmb where
          ..

        class Filter flt where
          .. 
    
-----

# Modelling ADTs

  * avoid boilerplate of writing different types differing by a few types

        type Users = [User]
        data User = User { name :: Text
                         , age :: Age
                         , dept :: Department
                         }

        type UsersAvgAge = [UserAvgAge]
        data UserAvgAge = UserAvgAge { name :: Text
                                     , avgAge :: Double
                                     , dept :: Department
                                     }     
     

-----

# Modelling ADTs (2)

  * HList representation
  
        data HList xs where
          (:>) :: x -> HList xs -> HList (fld ::: x ': xs)
          HNil :: HList '[]

        type User = HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                           , "age"  ::: Identity Age
                           , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                           ]

        type UserAvgAge =
             HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                    , "age"  ::: Identity Double
                    , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                    ]


-----

# Filter processing pipeline

   * Two types of filters
     - Transformational filters
     - Row filters

-----

# Transformational filters

   - transforms a particular field

        usrs = Read DB User { Map "age" :using-hs (+ 1) }
           name      age  department
        [ "person1", 20   , IT
        , "person2", 20   , IT
        ]
        =>
        [ "person1", 21   , IT
        , "person2", 21   , IT
        ]



   - Functors for the transformation

         class Functor f where
           fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-----

# Row filters

   - update on the rows

        usrAvgAge = Read DB User { Avg "age", GroupBy "dept"
                                 , Exclude "name" }
           name      age  department
        [ "person1", 20   , IT
        , "person2", 20   , IT
        , "person3", 25   , Sales
        ]
        =>
           name      age  department
        [ ()       , 20.0   , IT
        , ()       , 25.0   , Sales
        ]

-----

# Row filters (2)

   - Profunctors to capture the operation

          class Profunctor p where
             dimap :: (b -> a) -> (c -> d) -> p a c -> p b d

   - (->), Star, Fold from foldl are all profunctors. 

          usrAvgAge = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                    :using-hs (> 20) }
          -- data Star f a b = Star { runStar :: a -> f b }
          -- Star Maybe models filtering
          name => Star $ \x -> Just x
          age  => Star $ \x -> if x > 20
                               then Just x
                               else Nothing
          dept => Star $ \x -> Just x
-----

# Row filters (3)

   - stitch profunctors together by product profunctor

          name :: Star Maybe Text       Text
          age  :: Star Maybe Age        Age
          dept :: Star Maybe Department Department

          Star Maybe
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])

          class Profunctor p => ProductProfunctor p where
            purePP :: b -> p a b
	        (****) :: p a (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c


-----

# Row filters (4)

   - proMap to execute the pipeline
   
          class (Profunctor pro
                ) => ProMapping pro o' o | pro o' -> o where
           proMap :: pro x' x -> o' x' -> o x


-----

# Concurrent by default

          usrAndProfs =
            InnerJoin { usrs = Read DB User {} 
                      , profs = Api Profile {}
                      } { input joinOn
                        :with { usrs.id
                              , profs.userId
                              }
                        :using-hs `(==)`
                        }
 
  * haskell has lightweight green threads
 
    
-----

# Concurrent by default

 * Haxl - abstraction over "resources"

            usrAndProfs =
              innerJoin <$> dataFetch (Read :: Read DB User)
                        <*> dataFetch (Api  :: Api Profile )

 * ApplicativeDo makes it better!

          usrAndProfs = do
            usrs <- dataFetch (Read :: Read DB User)
            apis <- dataFetch (Api  :: Api Profile )
            innerJoin usrs apis

-----

# Downsides

   - Compilation time / memory consumed with a lot of type level operations is often high.
   - Error messages, if not handled by custom type errors, can be often
     very cryptic.

-----

# Takeaways

  - Higher level abstractions lets you solve bigger problems.
  - Types can be used to encode domain specific information, and compiler can used for analysis.
