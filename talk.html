# Haskell at ByteAlly

* Haskell from the beginning, for last 8 years.

* FMap - A transpiler to convert Haskell EDSL to mobile platforms generating human readable code. 
* FRF  - Workflow library that is easy to define & visualize business processes.
* TypeQL - A query language for the internet.

-----

# TypeQL

* Typed query language.
* Intended for stitching data from different sources and processing it.
* Being used currently in internal projects.

-----
# Actions

        usrs = Read DB User {}

        type Usrs = Read DB User '[]


-----

# Combinators

        usrCourses = Product { usrs  = Read DB User {} 
                             , courses = Api Course {}
                             } { }

        type UsrCourses =
          Product '[ "usrs"  := Read DB User '[]
                   , "courses" := Api Course '[]
                   ] '[ ]

-----

# Filters

        usrsAbove20 = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                     :using-hs `>= 20`
                                   }


        type Usrs = Read DB User '[ FilterBy '[S "age"]
                                    `Using` >= 20
                                  ]

- :using-{lang} . currently haskell is supported, close to adding js.

-----

# Reifying query 

  * Validations
    - invalid targetting

            usrs = Read DB User { FilterBy time }

    - filter type mismatch

            usrs = Read DB User { Avg name }

    - input type mismatch

            usrsAbove20 = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                         :using-hs `+ 1`
                                       }

-----

# Reifying query

  * Custom type errors for emitting domain specific errors.

        type family F a where
          F Int  = Int
          F a    = TypeError ('Text "It isn't an Int")

  * The reification is also used for editor completions.

-----

# Reifying query

- Generated type query is converted into a richer (type level) ast called tree.
- The reification is done with (closed) type families.

-----

# Extensibility

* Actions
  - SQL, WebApi, CSV, GPU

* Combinators
  - Joins, And, Or

* Filters
  - FilterBy, GroupBy, Avg, Sum

-----

# Modelling ADTs

  * avoid boilerplate of writing different types differing by a few types.

        newtype Age = Age { getAge :: Natural }
        newtype Department = Dept { getDept :: Text }

        data User = User { name :: Text
                         , age :: Age
                         , dept :: Department
                         }

        data UserAvgAge = UserAvgAge { name :: Text
                                     , avgAge :: Double
                                     , dept :: Department
                                     }     

-----

# Modelling ADTs (2)

  * HList representation
  
        data HList xs where
          (:>) :: x -> HList xs -> HList (fld ::: x ': xs)
          HNil :: HList '[]

        type User = HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                           , "age"  ::: Identity Age
                           , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                           ]

        type UserAvgAge =
             HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                    , "age"  ::: Identity Double
                    , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                    ]


-----

# Filter processing pipeline

   * Two types of filters
     - Transformational filters
     - Row filters

-----

# Transformational filters

   - transforms a particular field

        usrs = Read DB User { Map "age" :using-hs (+ 1) }
           name      age  department
        [ "person1", 20   , IT
        , "person2", 20   , IT
        ]
        =>
        [ "person1", 21   , IT
        , "person2", 21   , IT
        ]

-----

# Row filters

   - update on the rows

        usrAvgAge = Read DB User { Avg "age", GroupBy "dept"
                                 , Exclude "name" }
           name      age  department
        [ "person1", 20   , IT
        , "person2", 20   , IT
        , "person3", 25   , Sales
        ]
        =>
           age  department
        [  20.0   , IT
        ,  25.0   , Sales
        ]

-----

# Concurrent by default

  * actions run concurrently

          usrAndProfs =
            InnerJoin { usrs = Read DB User {} 
                      , profs = Api Profile {}
                      } { input joinOn
                        :with { usrs.id
                              , profs.userId
                              }
                        :using-hs `(==)`
                        }


  * haskell has lightweight green threads
 
-----

# Concurrent by default (2)

  * Haxl is a haskell library that simplifies access to remote data, such as databases or web-based services.

  * efficient scheduling of concurrent data accesses

          {-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}

          usrAndProfs = do
            usrs <- dataFetch (Read :: Read DB User)
            apis <- dataFetch (Api  :: Api Profile )
            innerJoin usrs apis

-----

# Downsides

   - Compilation time / memory consumed with a lot of type level operations is often high.
   - Error messages, if not handled by custom type errors, can be often
     very cryptic.
   - It is often hard to hire Haskell developers.
		    
-----

# Takeaways

  - Prevent bugs at compile time.
  - Query multiple sources of data while maintaining composibility as much as possible.
  - Queries run in parallel - thanks to excellent concurrency story of haskell.
  - Types can be used to encode domain specific information, and compiler can be used for analysis.

Addendum

# Row filters 

   - Profunctors to capture the operation

          class Profunctor p where
             dimap :: (b -> a) -> (c -> d) -> p a c -> p b d

   - (->), Star, Fold from foldl are all profunctors. 

          usrAvgAge = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                    :using-hs (> 20) }
          -- data Star f a b = Star { runStar :: a -> f b }
          -- Star Maybe models filtering
          name => Star $ \x -> Just x
          age  => Star $ \x -> if x > 20
                               then Just x
                               else Nothing
          dept => Star $ \x -> Just x
-----

# Row filters (2)

   - stitch profunctors together by product profunctor

          name :: Star Maybe Text       Text
          age  :: Star Maybe Age        Age
          dept :: Star Maybe Department Department

          Star Maybe
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])

          class Profunctor p => ProductProfunctor p where
            purePP :: b -> p a b
	        (****) :: p a (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c


-----

# Row filters (3)

   - proMap to execute the pipeline
   
          class (Profunctor pro
                ) => ProMapping pro f' f | pro f' -> f where
           proMap :: pro x' x -> f' x' -> f x
