# Haskell at ByteAlly

* Haskell from the beginning, for last 8 years.
* FMap - A transpiler to convert Haskell EDSL to mobile platforms generating human readable code. 
* FRF  - Workflow library that is easy to define &amp; visualize business processes.
* TypeQL - A query language for the internet.

Today: we're going to focus on TypeQL


-----

# TypeQL

* Typed query language.
* Intended for stitching data from different sources and processing it.
    * SQL
    * web apis
    * CSV
    * GPU computations.
* Being used currently in internal projects.

-----
# Actions

## TypeQL

    usrs = Read DB User {}

## Haskell

    type Usrs = Read DB User '[]

* Translated to haskell type level code to
  1. Avoid writing a custom type checker.
  2. Ensure everything is statically checked.

-----

# Combinators

## TypeQL

    usrCourses = Product { usrs  = Read DB User {} 
                         , courses = Api Course {}
                         } { }

## Haskell

    type UsrCourses =
      Product '[ "usrs"  := Read DB User '[]
               , "courses" := Api Course '[]
               ] '[ ]

-----

# Filters

## TypeQL

    usrsAbove20 = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                 :using-hs `&gt;= 20`
                               }

## Haskell

    type Usrs = Read DB User '[ FilterBy '[S "age"]
                                `Using` >= 20
                              ]

- `:using-{lang}`. Currently haskell is supported, close to adding js.

-----

# Validations

Powered by reifying and analyzing queries

## Invalid targetting

    usrs = Read DB User { FilterBy time }

## Filter type mismatch

    usrs = Read DB User { Avg name }

## Input type mismatch

    usrsAbove20 = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                 :using-hs `+ 1` }

-----

# Reifying query

- Generated type query is converted into a richer (type level) AST called tree.

- Validations performed on the reified tree.

- The reification is done with (closed) type families.

        type family F a where
          F Int  = Int
          F a    = TypeError ('Text "It isn't an Int")

- Custom type errors for emitting domain specific errors.

- The reification is also used for editor completions.

-----

# Extensibility

* Actions
  - SQL, WebApi, CSV, GPU

* Combinators
  - Joins, And, Or

* Filters
  - FilterBy, GroupBy, Avg, Sum

# Modelling ADTs

Avoid boilerplate of writing different types differing by a few types. With boilerplate:

    newtype Age = Age { getAge :: Natural }
    newtype Department = Dept { getDept :: Text }

    data User = User { name :: Text
                     , age :: Age
                     , dept :: Department
                     }

    data UserAvgAge = UserAvgAge { name :: Text
                                 , avgAge :: Double
                                 , dept :: Department
                                 }     

-----

# Modelling ADTs (2)

HList representation, no boilerplate:

    data HList xs where
      (:&gt;) :: x -&gt; HList xs -&gt; HList (fld ::: x ': xs)
      HNil :: HList '[]

    type User = HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                       , "age"  ::: Identity Age
                       , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                       ]

    type UserAvgAge =
         HList '[ "name" ::: Identity Text
                , "age"  ::: Identity Double
                , "dept" ::: Identity Department
                ]

-----

# Filter processing pipeline

Two types of filters

- Transformational filters
- Row filters

- Implemented via standard haskell abstractions

-----

# Transformational filters

Transforms a particular field

    usrs = Read DB User { Map "age" :using-hs (+ 1) }

       name      age  department
    [ "person1", 20   , IT
    , "person2", 20   , IT
    ]
    =&gt;
    [ "person1", 21   , IT
    , "person2", 21   , IT
    ]

-----

# Row filters

Update on the rows

    usrAvgAge = Read DB User { Avg "age", GroupBy "dept"
                             , Exclude "name" }

       name      age  department
    [ "person1", 20   , IT
    , "person2", 20   , IT
    , "person3", 25   , Sales
    ]
    =&gt;
       age  department
    [  20.0   , IT
    ,  25.0   , Sales
    ]

-----

# Concurrent by default

Actions run concurrently

    usrAndProfs =
      InnerJoin { usrs = Read DB User {} 
                , profs = Api Profile {}
                } { input joinOn
                  :with { usrs.id
                        , profs.userId
                        }
                  :using-hs `(==)`
                  }


Thanks to Haskell's lightweight green threads
 
-----

# Concurrent by default (2)

  * Haxl is a Haskell library that simplifies access to remote data, such as databases or web-based services.

  * Efficient scheduling of concurrent data accesses

          {-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}

          usrAndProfs = do
            usrs &lt;- dataFetch (Read :: Read DB User)
            apis &lt;- dataFetch (Api  :: Api Profile )
            innerJoin usrs apis

-----

# Downsides

   - Compilation time / memory consumed with a lot of type level operations is often high.
   - Error messages, if not handled by custom type errors, can be often
     very cryptic.
   - Type level code is syntactically and semantically different from normal haskell value code.
   - It is often hard to hire Haskell developers.
		    
-----

# Takeaways

  - Prevent bugs at compile time.
  - Avoid boilerplate of having different types.
  - Queries run concurrently - thanks to excellent concurrency story of Haskell.
  - Types can be used to encode domain specific information, and compiler can be used for analysis.

# Row filters 

   - Profunctors to capture the operation

          class Profunctor p where
             dimap :: (b -> a) -> (c -> d) -> p a c -> p b d

   - (->), Star, Fold from foldl are all profunctors. 

          usrAvgAge = Read DB User { FilterBy age
                                    :using-hs (> 20) }
          -- data Star f a b = Star { runStar :: a -> f b }
          -- Star Maybe models filtering
          name => Star $ \x -> Just x
          age  => Star $ \x -> if x > 20
                               then Just x
                               else Nothing
          dept => Star $ \x -> Just x
-----

# Row filters (2)

   - stitch profunctors together by product profunctor

          name :: Star Maybe Text       Text
          age  :: Star Maybe Age        Age
          dept :: Star Maybe Department Department

          Star Maybe
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])
          (HList '["name" ::: Text
                  , "age" ::: Age
                  , "dept" ::: Department])

          class Profunctor p => ProductProfunctor p where
            purePP :: b -> p a b
	        (****) :: p a (b -> c) -> p a b -> p a c


-----

# Row filters (3)

   - proMap to execute the pipeline
   
          class (Profunctor pro
                ) => ProMapping pro f' f | pro f' -> f where
           proMap :: pro x' x -> f' x' -> f x
